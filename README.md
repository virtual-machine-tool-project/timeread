| 6. what specifically going to do for the back-end of the project? What we’re specifically supposed to make an extremely 
lower-level multifunction program which abstracts from reversible gates via hardware abstraction
(which are sets of routines in software that emulate some platform-specific details,
giving programs direct access to the hardware resources, they often allow programmers to write device-independent,
high performance applications by providing standard operating system (OS) calls to hardware)
as to be able to manipulate the NAND cells to reverse (them) to any given (previous) state through
wireless remote controlling. So hence, in essence, it's obviously not traditional data recovery that we're doing here
but rather, it's (as was phrased in a single article about 2 of the topics that we’ll be covering with doing this project)
“data recovery in the digital forensic sense”, most of all, this said exact 
VMT’s supposed to be compatible with LITERALLY ANY & EVERYTHING (NAND) flash memory, like SSDs, USBs, etc.
